        <p class="indent">Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><span class="bold">Python is Interpreted: </span> Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</p></li>
          <li><p><span class="bold">Python is Interactive: </span> You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</p></li>
          <li><p><span class="bold">Python is Object-Oriented: </span> Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</p></li>
          <li><p><span class="bold">Python is a Beginner's Language: </span> Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</p></li>

        <p class="indent">Let us execute programs in different modes of programming.</p>
        <h4 class="indent">Interactive Mode Programming</h4>
        <p class="indent">Invoking the interpreter without passing a script file as a parameter brings up the following prompt:</p>
        <div>

        </div>
        <p class="indent">If you are running new version of Python, then you would need to use print statement with parenthesis as in <span class="bold">print ("Hello, Python!");</span>. However in Python version 2.4.3, this produces the following result:</p>

          <code>
            <p>Hello, Python!</p>

        <h4 class="indent">Script Mode Programming</h4>
        <p class="indent">Invoking the interpreter with a script parameter begins execution of the script and continues until the script is finished. When the script is finished, the interpreter is no longer active.</p>
        <p class="indent">Let us write a simple Python program in a script. Python files have extension .py. Type the following source code in a test.py file:</p>

        <header>Python Identifiers</header>
        <p class="indent">A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).</p>
        <p class="indent">Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.</p>
        <p class="indent">Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.</p></li>
          <li><p>Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.</p></li>
          <li><p>Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.</p></li>
          <li><p>If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.</p></li>

        <header>Lines and Indentation</header>
        <p class="indent">Python provides no braces to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.</p>
        <p class="indent">The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount. For example:</p>
        <div>
          <code>
            <p>if True:</p>
            <p class="indent">print "True"</p>
            <p>else:</p>
            <p class="indent">print "False"</p>
          </code>
        </div>
      <p class="indent">However, the following block generates an error</p>
      <div>
        <code>
          <p><span class="blue">if True:</span></p>
          <p><span class="blue">print</span> <span class="green">"Answer"</span></p>
          <p><span class="blue">print</span> <span class="green">"True"</span></p>
          <p><span class="blue">else:</span></p>
          <p><span class="blue">print</span> <span class="green">"Answer"</span></p>
          <p><span class="blue">print</span> <span class="green">"False"</span></p>
        </code>
      </div>
      <p class="indent">Thus, in Python all the continuous lines indented with same number of spaces would form a block.</p>

    <section id="quotation_in_python" class="main-section">
      <header>Quotation in Python</header>    
      <p class="indent">Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.</p>
      <p class="indent">The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For example, all the following are legal:</p>
      <div>
        <code>
          <p>word = 'word'</p>
          <p>sentence = "This is a sentence."</p>

    </section>
    <section id="comments_in_python" class="main-section"><header>Comments in Python</header>
      <p class="indent">A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment. All characters after the # and up to the end of the physical line are part of the comment and the Python interpreter ignores them.</p>

      <header>Variable Types</header>
      <p class="indent">Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.</p>
      <p class="indent">Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="assigning_values_to_variables" class="main-section">
      <header>Assigning Values to Variables</header>
      <p class="indent">Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.</p>
      <p class="indent">The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. For example:</p>
      <div>
        <code>
          <p><span class="darkred">#!/usr/bin/python</span><br>
          <p>counter = <span class="blue">100</span><span class="darkred">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp# An integer assignment</span></p>
          <p>miles   = <span class="blue">1000.0</span>  <span class="darkred">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp# A floating point</span></p>
          <p>name    = <span class="green">"John"</span><span class="darkred">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp# A string</span></p>
          <p><span class="blue">print</span> counter</p>
          <p><span class="blue">print</span> miles<p>
          <p><span class="blue">print</span> name</p>
        </code>
      </div>
      <p class="indent">Here, 100, 1000.0 and "John" are the values assigned to counter, miles, and name variables, respectively. This produces the following result:</p>
      <div>
        <code>
          <p>100</p>
          <p>1000.0</p>

    <section id="standard_data_types" class="main-section">
      <header>Standard Data Types</header>
      <p class="indent">The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.</p>
      <p class="indent">Python has five standard data types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><span class="bold">Numbers:</span> Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. Python supports four different numerical types: int (signed integers), long (long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal),float (floating point real values), complex (complex numbers).</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="bold">String:</span> Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 at the end.</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="bold">List:</span> Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. One difference between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.</p>
          <p>The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. The plus (+) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="bold">Tuple:</span> A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses.</p>
          <p>The main differences between lists and tuples are: Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="bold">Dictionary:</span> Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.</p>
          <p>Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces ([])</p></li>
